Identification of five cytotoxicity-related genes involved in the progression of breast cancer
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary	Breast cancer is one of the deadly tumors in women, and its incidence continues to increase. This study aimed to identify novel therapeutic molecules using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data of breast cancer from our hospitals.
 	
Overall design	30 pairs of normal and cancerous tissues from the same excision were collected from the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Guangzhou Army General Hospital. RNA sequencing was performed by Guangzhou Huayin Health medical Group. Original reads of RNA sequencing data were normalized as FPKM data.
